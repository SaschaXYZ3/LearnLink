# How to start a Webserver:

```bash
npm start nodemon
````

## In case it does not work:

```bash
npm install --save-dev nodemon #this installs it locally in the repo

node server.js #alternatively you can run this instead
```

If all of that fails you need to install npm first and init the project. However since I commited it for all, it should not be required.

npm install
npm init -y
